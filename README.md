Description of project
My project is an application for food reservation (dishes from the kitchen of a hotel or residence), in this application there are two different types of users (Guest and kitchen). The guest user can review the dishes in the kitchen and can make reservations, and can also edit and delete the reservations made. The kitchen user will be able to review the list of existing dishes, create, edit and delete existing dishes, and will also be able to review all reservations made by guest users. Users can enter the application with a username and password, if they do not have a user account they will be able to create an account.
